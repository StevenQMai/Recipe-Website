        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This chili dog mac and cheese casserole is a hearty, flavor-packed dish that brings together the beloved elements of chili dogs and classic mac and cheese, though with a unique twist. Ground beef, onions, and sliced hot dogs form the savory base, seasoned with bold spices like cumin, smoked paprika, and chili powder, creating a rich, chili-like sauce. Mixed with elbow macaroni and layered with shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses, this casserole delivers a creamy, slightly spicy experience. While it doesn’t exactly replicate the taste of either chili dogs or mac and cheese alone, it offers a comforting, goulash-inspired medley that’s sure to satisfy.</p>
        <p>Baked until golden and bubbly, this recipe is easy to assemble, making it ideal for gatherings or family dinners. After baking, a sprinkle of fresh green onions provides a pop of color and a slight tang. Chef John, the recipe’s creator, notes that despite the lack of a traditional creamy sauce, the flavors still meld wonderfully, creating a dish that’s deliciously savory with just the right amount of spice. Perfect for a crowd, this casserole is a unique twist on classic comfort food favorites and is bound to become a hit for any occasion.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>

            <li>2 generous teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican oregano</li>

            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>1 cup diced green peppers</li>

            <li>1 pound hot dogs, sliced</li>

            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes (or 3 1/2 cups tomato sauce or puree)</li>

            <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>

            <li>2 rounded cups elbow macaroni</li>

            <li>8 ounces shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>

            <li>8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>

            <li>green onions, sliced, for the top (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
            <li>Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir until combined, and transfer mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% of cheese to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole.</li>
            <li>Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the surface with the tip of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with green onions.</li>
        </ol>
